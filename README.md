## Insights and Recommendations
1. Overall Business Performance
- Sales Revenue: $772,769
- Total Cost: $502,025
- Net Profit: $270,744
- Total Orders: 555
- Insight:The business has a strong profit margin (about 35%). Revenue growth is positive, and profit appears to scale in line with revenue, meaning the business is managing cost efficiency well.
2. Order Status Breakdown
- 52% Completed
- 48% Returned
- Insight:A 48% return rate is extremely high. This is a major operational and commercial red flag. Nearly half of all orders failing indicates issues in product quality, shipping, customer experience, or expectations.
3. Revenue by Country
- Countries with the highest shading (highest contribution) appear to be:
  - United States
  - China
  - Australia
- Insight:Revenue is concentrated in a few key markets. Some regions (e.g., parts of Africa and Europe) generate very little.
4. Category Performance (Revenue, Cost, Profit)
- Apparel and Electronics generate the highest revenue.
- Books and Groceries contribute moderate revenue.
- Home Décor is the weakest-performing category.
- Insight:Although Apparel and Electronics drive revenue, you must check their profitability—both categories also show high costs, but still produce strong net profit. Home Décor underperforms across all metrics.
5. Payment Method Distribution
- Bank Transfer: 30%
- Mobile Money: 26%
- Credit Card: 23%
- Cash: 21%
- Insight:Customers use a diverse mix of payment options. Bank transfers lead, but cash still accounts for 1 in 5 transactions.
6. Monthly Trends
- Revenue fluctuates significantly month-to-month.
- Strong peaks appear around January, March, August, and December.
- Cost and profit follow revenue movements closely.
- Insight:The business shows seasonality, with end-of-year and some early-year peaks. This suggests promotions, events, or market cycles affect sales strongly.
7. Daily Revenue Trends
- Wednesday, Friday, and Monday are the strongest revenue days.
- Tuesday and Saturday are lower-performing days.
- Insight:Customer activity spikes midweek and at the start of the week. Saturday underperformance might indicate weak weekend traffic or operational issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Address the Extremely High Return Rate
- Almost half of orders being returned is a major business risk.
- Investigate the following:
  - Product quality issues
  - Wrong or late deliveries
  - Incorrect product descriptions
  - Poor packaging
  - Customer dissatisfaction
-  Recommendation: Run a root-cause analysis by segmenting return rates by country, product category, and payment method.
2. Focus Investment on High-Performing Categories
- Double down on Apparel and Electronics, where revenue and profit are strongest.
- Review pricing, cost structure, and marketing for Home Décor, which is currently draining performance.
3. Expand in High-Revenue Countries
- Scale marketing, partnerships, and distribution in USA, China, and Australia.
- Explore localized promotions in mid-tier markets like the UK and Brazil.
4. Smooth Out Seasonal Fluctuations
- Use the strong months (Jan, Mar, Aug, Dec) to:
- Run targeted promotions in weak months
- Introduce loyalty rewards or bundles
- Diversify advertising across seasons
5. Optimize Payment Options
- Since no single method dominates:
- Ensure all channels remain reliable
- Offer incentives for lower-cost payment methods
- Monitor the correlation between payment type and return rate
6. Leverage Daily Revenue Insights
- Push key promotions on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Mondays
- Address operational issues on low-sales days such as Tuesday
- Test weekend campaigns to lift Saturday revenue
